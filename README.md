# Final Project

This was a group challenge to see how well we can apply the knowledge we have gained over the last 10 weeks within the given time constraints to deploy a prebuilt application using technologies including Terraform, Kubernetes, Docker, Jenkins, and AWS.

One of the purposes of this project was for us to experience working to complete a deliverable as part of a team, this experience will be invaluable for your future interviews with clients.

# Requirements

You will need to plan, design, and implement a solution for automating the development workflows and deployments of this application. As part of your final deliverable, you will need to discuss the project in a presentation and demonstrate these workflows.

What tools will work for you best? For example: Terraform, Kubernetes, Ansible etc. There is no restrictions or requirements on which ones to use; you should decide which you feel are most appropriate and justify their use.

Multiple Environment support: How can a developer test their new features on an environment before merging their changes to the main branch?

How can changes on the GitHub repository automatically build and deploy to testing and live environments?

Running costs. What are your monthly estimates? How could they be improved?

# Pipeline

![Development Pipeline](images/FinalProjectPipeline.jpg)

Here is an Image of our pipeline, this diagram shows how we have organised the repo and then how once the application files have been pushed to main how they then filter through the said technologies we have used.

The pipeline is automated with a Webhook to Jenkins from GitHub. It is then integrated using a Jenkinsfile, from that Jenkinsfile we have 5 steps; Configuration, building with Docker, pushing to Dockerhub, orchestration with Terraform and then deployment with Kubernetes. Once the deployment the application can be viewed online.

The Configuration stage uses a shell script with sets up the machines with all the updates needed, and all the files downloaded to manage, prepare and setting up of the cluster. The Orchestration and Deployment stages again are both shell scripts and this initialises terraform and then applies the needed files.
